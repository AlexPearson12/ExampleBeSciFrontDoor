                <p>Consider these three scenarios:</p>

                <p><strong>1:</strong> In a dusty South African village, children's laughter rings out as they spin on a playground merry-go-round. Each rotation causes clear drinking water from a nearby pump to pour into villagers' buckets. It's an elegant solution: the children's play powers the water pump. Now, the villagers do not have to walk miles to fetch water, while the children also have a new and fun activity to engage in. This is a win-win scenario.</p>

                <p><strong>2:</strong> For the 1.6 million Americans with severe sesame allergies, a 2023 federal law promised both clarity and protection. The new legislation required explicit labelling of sesame in food products and mandated that manufacturers prevent cross-contamination. The goal was simple: make eating safer for millions of people.</p>

                <p><strong>3:</strong> In 2003, when singer and actress Barbra Streisand discovered her mansion had been photographed and labelled as part of the California Coastal Records Project, she took aggressive legal action to protect her privacy. Concerned about security, she filed a $50 million lawsuit against photographer Kenneth Adelman to get the image and her name removed. After all, shouldn't a private citizen have control over information that could compromise their safety?</p>

                <p>A playground water pump in Africa, a food safety law in America, and a celebrity's privacy battle appear unconnected. However, they illustrate a fascinating problem that emerges when we attempt to change human behaviour: <span class="highlight-text">even actions which appear perfectly intuitive can have unintended consequences</span>. Unfortunately, these consequences are often negative.</p>

                <h2>When Solutions Backfire</h2>

                <p>The water pump seemed like an innovative solution. It did pump water when children played. But consider: what happens when the children stop playing? Well, people still require water. So, the result was the women of the village working hard to push the merry-go-round to produce water—much harder than they would have done if they had been provided with a simple hand pump. Even more fundamentally, when the complicated pumping mechanisms broke down, no locals had the training required to fix them.</p>

                <p>The sesame labelling law backfired spectacularly. Rather than invest in new protocols to prevent cross-contamination, many large manufacturers began intentionally adding sesame to their products. For example, the American chain Olive Garden announced it was adding "a minimal amount of sesame flour due to the potential for cross-contamination at the bakery." This meant that thousands of previously safe foods for people with sesame allergies suddenly became dangerous. A law intended to protect allergic consumers had reduced their food options.</p>

                <p>When it came to Streisand's privacy lawsuit, it transformed an unknown photo into an internet sensation. Before the legal action, the image of her mansion had been viewed only six times on the photographer's website, two of which were by her own lawyers. After news of the lawsuit broke, the photo was viewed by over 420,000 people within a month. This incident led to the term "The Streisand Effect" to describe when attempts to hide information led to its widespread publicity.</p>

                    The relationship between causes and effects in human behaviour doesn't follow the reliable logic of mechanical systems.
                </blockquote>

                <h2>Understanding the Complexity</h2>

                <p>These cases highlight a crucial insight about changing human behaviour: while we often assume people will react to changes in simple, predictable ways—"If we do X, then surely Y will happen"—the reality is far more complex. The relationship between causes and effects in human behaviour doesn't follow the reliable logic of mechanical systems, where X always leads to Y. Instead, behaviour is multi-determined with complex interdependencies. In other words, it emerges from a complex web of interacting influences: genes, individual psychology, social context, economic incentives, and various environmental factors all shape how people respond to change. These various determinants don't just add up; they interact in ways that can amplify, diminish, or completely transform our intended effects.</p>

                <p>This is why, unlike designing mechanical systems where causes and effects are clear and predictable, systems involving human behaviour are sometimes referred to as "wicked problems" - where each attempted solution often reveals or creates new problems, where causes and effects are intertwined in complex feedback loops, and where every intervention changes the nature of the problem itself. Our failure to acknowledge this complexity invariably leads to the kind of unintended consequences described above.</p>

                <h2>Cultivating Scepticism</h2>

                <p>If you are designing anything that involves changing human behaviour, the first and most critical step in avoiding unintended consequences is to treat your own intuitions with deep scepticism. When you find yourself constructing a neat, tidy chain of arguments for a particular solution, warning bells should sound. Listen carefully for phrases like "Surely we just need to..." Such language often betrays an unwarranted certainty about cause and effect in complex systems.</p>

                <p>To develop this crucial scepticism, we can take inspiration from Alfred P. Sloan, the longtime president and chair of General Motors. The story goes that during an executive committee meeting, when faced with unanimous agreement on a major decision, he reportedly said:</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "Gentlemen, I take it we are all in complete agreement on the decision here... Then I propose we postpone further discussion of this matter until our next meeting to give ourselves time to develop disagreement and perhaps gain some understanding of what the decision is all about."
                </blockquote>

                <p>While you may not have an executive committee to challenge your thinking, you can apply this principle to your own decision-making. Can you step back from the problem and deliberately cultivate uncertainty about your proposed solution? Doing so will likely feel uncomfortable, as uncertainty in beliefs generates psychological discomfort that motivates us to resolve it. Yet when it comes to changing behaviour, resisting the allure of obvious and comfortable solutions is an essential first step. It means that we must develop epistemic humility, where we expose, challenge, recognise and contend with the limits of our knowledge and intuitions.</p>

                <p>This systematic cultivation of doubt echoes philosopher Karl Popper's fundamental insight: we advance knowledge not by proving our theories right but by actively trying to prove them wrong. When dealing with human behaviour, this mindset becomes essential. While formal behavioural science tools exist for analysing and mitigating unintended consequences, they can only help once we've developed our inner scepticism. The following questions can help us develop the type of rigorous self-questioning required.</p>

                <h3>What makes this solution seem so obvious to you?</h3>

                <p>Sometimes, what feels obvious reflects our own limited experience or perspective. The playground water pump seemed obviously beneficial to its designers. After all, who could object to combining play with the necessity for pumping water? But such obviousness blinded them to three crucial questions: How much water would children's natural play actually produce? What would happen when water was needed, but children were not playing? Who would be required to generate water when the children were not playing?</p>

                <p>Obvious solutions are also often supported by a hidden chain of unexamined beliefs about how people will behave. Streisand obviously needed to sue to protect her privacy. The lawsuit would simply get the photo removed, and this would mean fewer people knew where she lived. Unfortunately for her, this chain of assumptions completely misunderstood how information spreads in the digital age.</p>

                <h3>What would someone who disagrees with you say?</h3>

                <p>Try to imagine the strongest possible case against your idea. In doing so, resist the urge to build a straw man - an overly simplistic version of opposing arguments that is easy to dismiss. Consider the advocates of the sesame labelling law. From their perspective, there was a clear and straightforwardly beneficial case. But what if they had seriously considered the manufacturers' perspective? Would they have anticipated that economics and risk management would drive companies to add sesame to more products rather than prevent cross-contamination? Would this have changed their proposals?</p>

                <h3>Can you mentally simulate five different ways your intervention might play out?</h3>

                <p>Do not stop at your first idealised scenario. Push yourself to imagine multiple alternative paths, especially ones that do not end well. Most of us settle for our initial plausible story of success instead of assuming that reality will not follow our neatly preferred script.</p>

                <h3>What would make you change your mind?</h3>

                <p>If you cannot imagine any evidence that would make you question your "obvious" solution, that is a red flag. It shows you are no longer trying to find the right answer; you are simply defending your first answer.</p>

                <blockquote class="pull-quote">
                    True expertise in human behaviour is not about having immediate and easy solutions; it begins by cultivating the ability to question ourselves, especially when we feel most certain.
                </blockquote>

                <h2>The First Principle</h2>

                <p>The same core idea that physicist Richard Feynman identified as essential to the scientific process is particularly prescient here:</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool."
                </blockquote>

                <p>When it comes to changing human behaviour, this principle becomes our guide. Before we rush to implement the obvious solution, before we assume we know how people will respond, we must first develop the humility to question our own certainty. Only then can we begin to navigate the complex, interconnected systems that shape human behaviour—and perhaps avoid adding our own chapter to the catalogue of good ideas gone wrong.</p>
