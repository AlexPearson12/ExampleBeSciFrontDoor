            <h1>Behavioural Science is…</h1>
            <p class="lead">Applied behavioural science is the systematic application of psychological, social, and behavioural research to understand and influence human behaviour in real-world contexts.</p>
            <p>We draw on evidence from psychology, economics, sociology, neuroscience, systems thinking, and evolution. We combine it with context-specific research to develop interventions that work.</p>

                    <p>We focus on what people actually do, not what they say they'll do, not their attitudes or intentions.</p>

                    <h3>Science is the process</h3>
                    <p>We use the scientific method. That means we observe patterns, develop hypotheses about why those patterns exist, design tests to examine those hypotheses, and draw conclusions from the data. This allows us to design interventions that actually change behaviour, rather than just sounding like they should work.</p>
